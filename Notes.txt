This is a self updaing transparent / translucent form. It's cthru!
I expanded on Kevin Tupper's work after he posted code using BoS's blending dll. I needed to have the form update when the background changed so I rewrote the routines and added the new code. If you have any comments or suggestions, have at it. (exarkun@angelwire.com)

Variables You Set:
cthru - (0-255) - set opacity

Side Effects:
- The form flickers slightly while it hides it self to take the clean snapshot of the background.

In General:
- The two "SetWindowPos" routines are cranky. They don't want to accept variables as their sizes. The numbers have to be hard coded in at design time.
- In the "Paint" routine you'll need to rem out some statements depending on whether the form will have a border or not. (It's clearly marked)
- Msimg32.dll & Alphablending.dll are in the zip. If your computer does not have these files you may need to install them before running the project.
- Next I want to include region clipping so I can round off the edges of the window. I have no idea if this will affect the blending routine.
